What does top markers overlap with?


```{r}

topwide <- 
read_delim("../data/geoduck_topmarkers_annot.txt", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
select(gene_id, cell_group, specificity, gene_ID) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = cell_group, values_from = specificity) %>%
rename_with(~paste0("cellgroup_",.), -c("gene_id", "gene_ID"))

```


```{r}
sc_tissue <- left_join(topwide, tissue)
```

```{r}
left_join(topwide, tissue) %>%
  filter(cellgroup_1 >0) %>%
  select(gene_id, gene_ID, ctenidia, heart, gonad, larvae, juvenile)
```
